# Word Counter

## Objectives

* Display your understanding of:
	* AJAX
	* String Manipulation
	* Associative Arrays

## Directions

This lab involves reading in a text file, word by word. Each unique word will be stored once and only once in an accociative array. Each additional occurrence of that word found in the text will cause an associated counter to be incremented. Once all the words have been counted output all the words in the map with their occurences.

Create an object that can be except a text file location as well as display the result of the word count. Also display the count of unique words, most/least used words and the longest word. Finally create a method that accepts a string value and return the word count of that string value.

You will find a text file at the below location for you to use but your program should be able to work on any text file.
